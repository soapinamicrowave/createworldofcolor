# **Create: World of Color**

...is a resource pack designed to emulate what [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create) would look like in Minecraft's Programmer Art style.

# Downloads

Downloads will be frequently pushed to [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/create-world-of-color), or you can just click **<> Code** and **Download ZIP**, which *SHOULD* work.
Hypothetically, [this](https://github.com/soapinamicrowave/createworldofcolor/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) should work too.
